MOVIE SET CHANGES:
Due to recent changes in Kodi we've changed our internal handling of movie sets:
- the sorttitle of movies in a movie set is no longer used
  (tinyMediaManager and Kodi use the release date to sort)
- tinyMediaManager now supports the new NFO style for movie sets
  (reading & writing; we also support reading the old style for importing)

! Due to the NFO changes and sorttitle changes you should rewrite the NFO                   !
! files of your movies if you use movie sets! (Don't forget to re-import your movies in Kodi) !
